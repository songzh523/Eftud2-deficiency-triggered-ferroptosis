Spliceosomal GTPase Eftud2 deficiency-triggered ferroptosis leads to Purkinje cell degeneration
Spliceosomal GTPase Elongation factor Tu GTP binding domain containing 2 (EFTUD2) is a causative gene for mandibulofacial dysostosis with microcephaly (MFDM) syndrome comprising cerebellar hypoplasia and motor dysfunction. 
How EFTUD2 deficiency contributes to these symptoms remains elusive.
Here, we demonstrate that specific ablation of Eftud2 in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) in mice results in severe ferroptosis, PC degeneration, dyskinesia and cerebellar atrophy, which recapitulates phenotypes observed in MFDM patients. 
Mechanistically, Eftud2 promotes Scd1 and Gch1 expression, upregulates monounsaturated fatty acids-phospholipids, and enhances antioxidant activity, thereby suppressing PC ferroptosis.
Importantly, we identified transcription factor Atf4 as a downstream target to regulate anti-ferroptosis effects in PCs in a p53-independent manner. 
Inhibiting ferroptosis efficiently rescued cerebellar deficits in Eftud2 cKO mice. Our data reveal an important role of Eftud2 in maintaining PC survival, 
and that pharmacological or genetic inhibiting ferroptosis may be a promising therapeutic strategy for EFTUD2 deficiency-induced disorders.
